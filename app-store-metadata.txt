DESCRIPTION (4000 chars max)
--------------------------------------------
Claudio is a minimal, beautiful client for talking to your AI agents — by voice or by text.

Connect to any OpenClaw-compatible server and start a conversation. Claudio handles voice input, real-time transcription, and text-to-speech so you can have natural, hands-free conversations with your AI.

HOW IT WORKS
• Enter your server URL in Settings — that's it
• Choose from your server's available agents
• Type a message or tap the voice button for a full voice conversation
• Voice sessions show a live transcript and play back AI responses as speech

FEATURES
• Voice mode with real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech
• Full-screen voice sessions with live scrolling transcript
• Clean, dark interface designed for focus
• Works with any OpenClaw-compatible backend
• No account required — no sign-up, no login
• Zero data collection — your conversations stay on your device and your server

PRIVACY FIRST
Claudio collects no data whatsoever. No analytics, no tracking, no ads. Your server URL is stored locally on your device. Conversations are between you and your server.

REQUIREMENTS
• Claudio is a client app — you need access to a compatible AI server
• The server handles all AI processing; Claudio is the interface

APP REVIEW NOTES
--------------------------------------------
Claudio is a client app that connects to user-provided AI server URLs. To test, you will need a server running an OpenClaw-compatible backend. The app itself does not include AI models or process data — it sends messages to the configured server and displays responses.

If you need a test server URL for review, please contact us at hello@kochi.to.
